# SayWhat Dashboard

There are two components to the dashboard.  The first is a frontend
for the data catalog.  The second is a sample application to display
the use of the warehouse itself.  Discussion trends for an arbitrarily
chosen month can be investigated by search term.

The dashboard is built using the Flask framework.

For a video demonstration of its use, please see
